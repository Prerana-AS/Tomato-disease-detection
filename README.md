# Tomato-disease-detection
# 🍅 Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

A deep learning-based web app built with **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow** that detects tomato leaf diseases from uploaded images.

## 🚀 How it Works
1. Upload an image of a tomato leaf.
2. The model analyzes it using transfer learning (DenseNet121).
3. The app predicts the disease class with confidence percentage.
